# Python Dont Miss Live

## Introduction

Dont Miss Live is a convenient command-line tool designed for users who are often away from their computers and need to access live game streams that offer in-game rewards (drops).

## How it Works

Dont Miss Live allows you to specify a link and a scheduled time. When the scheduled time matches the local time of your computer, the link will automatically open in your default web browser. This enables you to log into game streams and claim any drops or rewards without needing to be present at your computer when the live starts.

## Usage

1. Run the Python program and provide the link you want to open.
2. Enter the scheduled time for the link to be opened.
3. Optionally, specify your preferred web browser to open the link (leave blank for default).
4. The program will continuously check the current time and, when the scheduled time is reached, it will open the link in the selected web browser.

1. Download the repository.
